"In a patient with low back pain, what clinical features should raise suspicion for spinal cancer or infection?","Features include fever or chills, unexplained weight loss, history of cancer, immunosuppression, pain at rest or at night, intravenous drug use, or bacteraemia.","**Question 1:** In a patient with low back pain, what clinical features should raise suspicion for spinal cancer or infection?

**Answer:**  Features include fever or chills, unexplained weight loss, history of cancer, immunosuppression, pain at rest or at night, intravenous drug use, or bacteraemia.


**Question 2:**  What is the recommended imaging modality for investigating suspected spinal cancer or infection in a patient with low back pain?

**Answer:** MRI is indicated.


**Question 3:** What is the rationale for using MRI in patients with low back pain and suspected spinal cancer or infection?

**Answer:** MRI can localize the area and extent of disease, allowing for investigation of lumbar spinal involvement when cancer or infection is suspected.


**Question 4:**  A patient presents with low back pain and a history of recent intravenous drug use. Should spinal infection be considered?

**Answer:** Yes, intravenous drug use is a feature that raises suspicion for spinal infection.


**Question 5:** A patient with low back pain reports worsening pain at night.  Should this raise any specific concerns?

**Answer:** Yes, pain at rest or at night is a feature suggesting potential spinal cancer or infection.


**Question 6:**  A patient with a known history of cancer presents with new onset low back pain. What imaging is recommended?

**Answer:** MRI is indicated.


**Question 7:**  What is the role of  a patient's medical history in the diagnostic process for spinal cancer or infection?

**Answer:**  A history of cancer or immunosuppression is a significant factor in suspecting spinal cancer or infection.


**Question 8:**  A patient presents with low back pain, fever, and chills. What imaging modality is most appropriate?

**Answer:** MRI is indicated.


**Question 9:** Unexplained weight loss is noted in a patient experiencing low back pain. Should this be investigated further?

**Answer:** Yes, unexplained weight loss is a feature that raises suspicion for spinal cancer or infection.


**Question 10:**  Besides MRI, are there any other diagnostic tests that might be considered in these cases?

**Answer:** The source does not specify other tests beyond MRI for initial investigation.


**Question 11:**  What is the clinical significance of localizing the area and extent of disease in spinal pathology?

**Answer:**  Localization by MRI helps guide further management and treatment of the spinal involvement.


**Question 12:**  A patient with low back pain and bacteremia is found. What imaging modality is most appropriate for further investigation of the spine?

**Answer:** MRI is indicated.


**Question 13:**  How does immunosuppression influence the likelihood of spinal infection?

**Answer:** The provided text does not specify a grade of recommendation or level of evidence.


**Question 15:** Should a patient with low back pain and suspected spinal cancer be referred to a specialist? If so, which one?

**Answer:**  The source does not specify which specialist, but referral to an oncologist and/or neurosurgeon would be appropriate.


**Question 16:**  What are the potential consequences of delaying MRI in a patient with suspected spinal cancer or infection?

**Answer:** The source does not explicitly detail consequences, but delay could hinder timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially worsening outcomes.


**Question 17:**  Can a diagnosis of spinal infection or cancer be made solely on the basis of clinical features?

**Answer:** No,  imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosis and localization.


**Question 18:**  What is the role of a physical examination in the evaluation of low back pain with suspected spinal pathology?

**Answer:** The source does not detail physical exam components but it would be a standard part of the assessment.


**Question 19:**  Besides cancer and infection, are there other possible causes of low back pain that should be considered?

**Answer:** While the source focuses on cancer and infection, other causes of low back pain are not excluded.


**Question 20:**  Is it appropriate to order an MRI for all patients presenting with low back pain?

**Answer:** No, MRI is indicated specifically when cancer or infection is suspected, based on associated clinical features.

**Question 4:**  A patient presents with low back pain and a history of recent intravenous drug use. Should spinal infection be considered?

**Answer:** Yes, intravenous drug use is a feature that raises suspicion for spinal infection.


**Question 5:** A patient with low back pain reports worsening pain at night.  Should this raise any specific concerns?

**Answer:** Yes, pain at rest or at night is a feature suggesting potential spinal cancer or infection.


**Question 6:**  A patient with a known history of cancer presents with new onset low back pain. What imaging is recommended?

**Answer:** MRI is indicated.


**Question 7:**  What is the role of  a patient's medical history in the diagnostic process for spinal cancer or infection?

","For more information, refer to clinical protocol When to order MRI for low back pain, Section Recommendation  5 , Pages [3]",Recommendation  5 ,[3],"Patients with low back pain and cancer or infection (suspected or known) 

MRI is indicated.



One should suspect cancer or infection of the spine when a patient with low back pain presents with associated features such as fever or chills, unexplained weight loss, history of cancer, immunosuppression, pain at rest or at night, intravenous drug use, or bacteraemia. MRI can localise the area and extent of disease, and hence it is indicated to investigate lumbar spinal involvement when cancer or infection is suspected.
